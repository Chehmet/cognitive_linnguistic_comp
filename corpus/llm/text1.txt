Volume I: The Summons
Chapter I – A Letter of Grave Importance
It was a truth universally acknowledged that a young woman of modest means and respectable lineage must, at some point in her life, confront the specter of an unexpected inheritance—particularly if said inheritance involved a crumbling estate, a family secret, and the distinct possibility of foul play.

Miss Eleanor Pembroke, aged two-and-twenty, had never considered herself the sort of person to whom such dramatic turns of fate might occur. She was neither the heroine of a gothic novel nor the long-lost heiress of a noble house. She was, in fact, a practical woman—or so she had always believed—until the day the letter arrived.

The missive was delivered not by the usual post, but by a gaunt stranger in a mud-splattered greatcoat, who thrust it into the hands of Eleanor’s bewildered housemaid before vanishing into the fog-shrouded streets of London. The paper itself was thick, expensive, and sealed with an unfamiliar crest: a raven with outstretched wings, its beak parted as if in mid-screech.

Eleanor turned it over in her hands, her pulse quickening.

"To Miss Eleanor Pembroke, of No. 12 Gracechurch Street, London.

Madam,—It is with the utmost urgency that I write to inform you of your relation to the late Sir Reginald Blackwood, of Blackwood Hall, Yorkshire. As the sole surviving heir of the Blackwood line, you are hereby summoned to attend the reading of the will at the aforementioned estate on the 15th instant. Failure to comply shall result in the forfeiture of all claims to title, property, and associated fortunes.

Yours in haste,—J. Wrexham, Solicitor."

Eleanor stared at the words as though they might rearrange themselves into something more sensible.

Blackwood Hall.

The name alone conjured images of drafty corridors, whispered scandals, and the kind of ancestral skeletons that were best left firmly in their closets.

"Aunt Margaret," she called, her voice steadier than she felt, "did my father ever speak of a relation named Sir Reginald Blackwood?"

Her aunt, a formidable woman who had long since declared herself "done with surprises," lowered her embroidery with a frown. "Blackwood? Good heavens, child, why do you ask?"

Eleanor handed her the letter.

Aunt Margaret’s spectacles slipped down her nose as she read. Then, with a sharp intake of breath, she muttered, "Oh dear. This is most inconvenient."

Chapter II – A Journey Northward
Three days later, Eleanor found herself aboard a rattling stagecoach bound for Yorkshire, her trunk secured atop the carriage, her lap desk balanced precariously on her knees as she attempted to compose a letter to her dearest friend, Miss Arabella Thorne.

"Dearest Bella,—I write to you from the depths of what I can only describe as a dreadful misadventure. I am en route to a place called Blackwood Hall, which, from the little I have gathered, is either a den of thieves, a nest of ghosts, or the setting of a particularly convoluted legal dispute. The solicitor’s letter was vague to the point of absurdity, and Aunt Margaret—who usually knows everything—claims to have only the haziest recollection of our connection to the Blackwoods. All she would say was, 'Your father never spoke of them, and for good reason.' Which, as you can imagine, does nothing to ease my nerves."

The coach hit a particularly vicious bump, sending Eleanor’s inkwell sliding toward the edge of the desk. She caught it just in time, but not before a few droplets splattered across her gloves.

"Blast," she muttered, blotting the mess with her handkerchief.

The gentleman seated across from her—a lean, sharp-featured man in a well-tailored but slightly shabby coat—raised an eyebrow. "Trouble with your correspondence, madam?"

Eleanor forced a polite smile. "Nothing that cannot be remedied with a fresh sheet of paper, sir."

He inclined his head. "I admire your fortitude. Most ladies of my acquaintance would have succumbed to hysterics by now."

"And most gentlemen of my acquaintance," she replied sweetly, "would have offered their own handkerchief rather than remarking on the lack of one."

To her surprise, he laughed—a warm, rich sound that seemed out of place in the cramped confines of the coach. "Touché, Miss…?"

"Pembroke," she said, wary but intrigued.

"Jonathan Harrow," he returned, with a slight bow that was somewhat impeded by the lack of space. "At your service."

Something in his manner—the way his eyes lingered just a second too long, the faint smirk playing at the corner of his mouth—set Eleanor’s nerves on edge.

And why, she wondered, is a man who speaks like a gentleman dressed like a man who cannot afford to be one?

Chapter III – Arrival at Blackwood Hall
The sun had long since set by the time the coach deposited Eleanor at the edge of a winding drive, the solicitor’s directions clutched in her hand. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and the only sound was the distant hoot of an owl.

Then, looming out of the darkness like a specter, stood Blackwood Hall.

The house was a monstrous thing—a jumble of Gothic arches and sagging rooftops, its windows dark and hollow as empty eye sockets. A single lantern flickered above the door, casting long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown lawn.

Eleanor took a deep breath and lifted the knocker.

The door creaked open before she could strike it, revealing a stooped, ancient butler whose expression suggested he had not expected visitors—or, indeed, any form of human interaction—in quite some time.

"Miss Pembroke, I presume?" he intoned, his voice like dry parchment.

"Yes," she said, resisting the urge to take a step back.

"Mr. Wrexham is expecting you."

The interior of the house was, if possible, even more unsettling than the exterior. The walls were lined with portraits of grim-faced ancestors, their eyes seeming to follow Eleanor as she passed. The air smelled of mildew and something faintly metallic—like old blood.

The solicitor, a gaunt man with a permanently pinched expression, rose from behind a massive oak desk as she entered the study.

"Ah, Miss Pembroke. Punctual. I approve."

Eleanor folded her arms. "Mr. Wrexham, I should like to know precisely why I have been summoned here."

He steepled his fingers. "All in good time, my dear. First, there is the matter of the will."

He produced a yellowed document and began to read.

"I, Sir Reginald Blackwood, being of sound mind—"

A deafening crash echoed from somewhere upstairs.

Eleanor jumped. "What was that?"

Wrexham did not even glance up. "The house settling, no doubt. Now, as I was saying—"

Another crash. Then—unmistakably—the sound of footsteps overhead.

Eleanor stood. "There is someone else in this house."

The solicitor sighed, as though she were a particularly tiresome pupil. "Miss Pembroke, I assure you, Blackwood Hall has been empty for years."

"Then explain the footsteps."

Before he could answer, the door burst open—and there, framed in the doorway, stood Jonathan Harrow, the mysterious stranger from the coach.

His coat was torn, his knuckles bloodied, and his expression one of grim triumph.

"Miss Pembroke," he said, "I suggest you run."
