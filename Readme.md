# Quantitative Analysis of Cognitive-Linguistic Markers in Text

## Overview

This project provides a quantitative analysis of cognitive-linguistic markers (metaphoricity, synesthesia, associativity) in various text types. We compare human-authored content (poetry, prose, songs, scientific articles) with texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini Pro, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Methodology Highlights

The project leverages `spaCy`'s `en_core_web_md` model to calculate heuristic scores for:
* **Metaphoricity:** Semantic incongruity in adjective-noun and verb-noun pairs.
* **Synesthesia:** Blending of sensory experiences in adjective-noun pairs.
* **Associativity:** Overall semantic distance between content words.

Texts are preprocessed for consistency (cleaning, truncation).

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git`
2.  **Navigate to project directory:** `cd your-repo-name`
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
    ```
4.  **Place your text files** in the `corpus/` subdirectories.
5.  **Run analysis script:** `python src/main_analysis.py` (or your main script name).
6.  **Compile `report.tex`** using your preferred LaTeX environment (e.g., Overleaf).

## Future Work

Key areas for improvement include:
* Developing more advanced, context-aware ML/DL models for marker detection.
* Expanding and diversifying the text corpus for greater statistical validity.
* Conducting rigorous human validation studies.
* Implementing sophisticated statistical analyses.
